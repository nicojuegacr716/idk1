# Lifetech4Cloud Attribution Certificate v1.0

Issued on behalf of the Lifetech4Cloud founders to recognize and protect the authorship of:

1. **Lê Hùng Quang Minh** - Principal architect of the Discord-authenticated VPS marketplace, rewarded-ads ledger, and operational runbooks.
2. **Phạm Minh Đức** - Principal engineer of the NVIDIA DLI worker network, automation scripts, and support tooling.

## Scope
This certificate applies to the entire `lifetech4cloud` repository, including all directories (`backend`, `worker`, generated assets, and documentation) and any derivative works or deployments built from it.

## Rights Granted
You may use, modify, fork, and redistribute the codebase - commercially or non-commercially - provided that you comply with the obligations below. The certificate does not restrict the use of standard open-source tooling, dependencies, or third-party libraries bundled with this project.

## Obligations (Credit Is Mandatory)
1. **Prominent Attribution** - Every redistribution (source or binary) must display the text `Built with Lifetech4Cloud by Lê Hùng Quang Minh & Phạm Minh Đức` in its README, documentation, and any end-user UI footer or About dialog. The names must remain fully accented.
2. **Certificate Preservation** - The full contents of this `CERTIFICATE.md` file must be included, unmodified, in any fork, bundle, or packaged artifact so downstream users are aware of the credit requirements.
3. **Derivative Notices** - When publishing articles, demos, or marketing material based on this project, you must mention both certificate holders and link back to the original repository (or its canonical mirror) so observers can verify provenance.
4. **No Removal of Credits** - You may add your own attribution, but you may not remove, obscure, or downgrade the visibility of the required credit line in documentation or UI surfaces.
5. **License Compatibility** - If you attach an additional license to your fork, it must explicitly incorporate these attribution obligations. In case of conflict, the stricter credit requirement in this certificate prevails.

## Verification & Contact
If you need a custom commercial agreement, dual licensing, or written verification of compliance, contact the certificate holders through the repository’s issue tracker or the official Lifetech4Cloud channels.

By using this repository you acknowledge and accept the terms above. Failure to comply may result in revocation of your rights to use Lifetech4Cloud assets.
